# Multiplayer Testing Guide

## Overview
The multiplayer system has been implemented and debugged. Here's how to test it:

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Local vs Remote Player Management
- Each client has exactly ONE local player (`isLocalPlayer = true`, `isNetworkEntity = false`)
- Remote players are created for all OTHER connected players (`isLocalPlayer = false`, `isNetworkEntity = true`)
- Local player never receives network updates to prevent control conflicts

### 2. Player Serialization & Synchronization
- Player class now properly serializes network-specific data (networkPlayerId, playerName, etc.)
- Host sends full game state to new clients, including all player entities
- Clients create remote players from snapshots for all OTHER players

### 3. Entity Synchronization
- Host periodically sends entity updates to all clients
- Clients send their local player updates to the host
- Network entities are properly interpolated
- Local player is never treated as a network entity

## Testing Functions Available in Browser Console

### Basic State Inspection
```javascript
// Check current multiplayer state
checkMultiplayerState()

// View all entities and players
testMultiplayer()
```

### Host/Client Testing  
```javascript
// Test hosting a game
testHostGame()

// Test joining a game
testJoinGame()

// Create a test remote player manually
createTestRemotePlayer()
```

## Expected Behavior

### Host Flow:
1. Call `testHostGame()`
2. Local player gets networkPlayerId = 'test_host_123'
3. Local player remains `isLocalPlayer = true, isNetworkEntity = false`
4. When clients join, host creates remote players for them

### Client Flow:
1. Call `testJoinGame()`  
2. Local player gets networkPlayerId = 'test_client_456'
3. Local player remains `isLocalPlayer = true, isNetworkEntity = false`
4. Client receives full game state and creates remote player for host
5. Client sees host as remote player in game world

### Key Verification Points:
- Only ONE local player should exist per client
- Local player should NEVER be a network entity
- Remote players should be network entities
- Each client should see OTHER players as remote entities
- Network updates should never affect the local player

## Debug Output Examples

### Correct Local Player (after hosting):
```
Local Player:
   ID: 1
   Network ID: test_host_123
   Name: Host_test_host_123
   Is Local: true
   Is Network Entity: false
```

### Correct Remote Player (on client):
```
Remote Players (1):
   Player 1:
     ID: 10000
     Network ID: test_host_123
     Name: Host_test_host_123
     Is Network Entity: true
```

## Common Issues to Watch For:
- ❌ Local player becoming a network entity
- ❌ Multiple local players existing
- ❌ Client trying to control host's player
- ❌ Network updates being applied to local player
- ❌ Remote players not appearing in game world

## Files Modified:
- `src/MultiplayerManager.ts` - Core multiplayer logic
- `src/Player.ts` - Player serialization and remote player creation
- `src/Entity.ts` - Entity serialization improvements
- `src/main.ts` - Debug functions and integration
