# WebRTC Signaling Testing Plan

## Test Objective
Verify that the WebRTC signaling fixes resolve the issue where:
1. Client browser tab always shows "waiting" state while host shows "connection established"
2. Chat messages are not being transmitted between browser tabs during manual signaling

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors in Net.ts (missing line breaks in method declarations)
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors in Renderer.ts and InputManager.ts (similar line break issues)
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript error in ManualSignalingUI.ts (HTMLElement vs HTMLButtonElement casting)
- ✅ Fixed WebRTC connection state management in setupConnectionStateHandlers()
- ✅ Fixed setupDataChannelHandlers() to properly handle connection establishment
- ✅ Enhanced connection state monitoring with both onconnectionstatechange and oniceconnectionstatechange

## Test Steps

### 1. Host Setup
1. Open browser tab A at http://localhost:5173
2. Press 'M' key to open Manual Signaling UI
3. Click "Create Host"
4. Copy the generated offer string
5. Verify host tab shows "waiting for client" state

### 2. Client Setup  
1. Open browser tab B at http://localhost:5173
2. Press 'M' key to open Manual Signaling UI
3. Click "Join as Client"
4. Paste the offer string from step 1.4
5. Click "Process Input"
6. Copy the generated answer string
7. Verify client tab shows "waiting for host response" state

### 3. Complete Connection
1. Return to host tab (A)
2. Paste the answer string from step 2.6
3. Click "Process Input"
4. Verify both tabs show "connection established" status
5. Close Manual Signaling UI on both tabs

### 4. Test Chat Communication
1. On either tab, press 'Enter' key to open chat
2. Type a test message and press Enter to send
3. Verify message appears in both tabs with sender identification
4. Send messages from both tabs alternately
5. Verify bidirectional chat communication works

## Expected Results
- ✅ Both host and client should show "connection established" status
- ✅ WebRTC peer connection should reach "connected" state on both sides
- ✅ Data channel should open successfully on both sides
- ✅ Chat messages should transmit bidirectionally
- ✅ No more "waiting" state persistence on client side

## Key Code Changes Made

### Net.ts
1. **setupConnectionStateHandlers()**: Now properly monitors connection state and only sets up data channel handlers when connection reaches "connected" state
2. **processAnswer()**: Removed immediate connection state setting - now waits for actual WebRTC connection
3. **createAnswer()**: Enhanced to properly store connections and set up state monitoring
4. **setupDataChannelHandlers()**: Enhanced to handle connection timing and add delay for PLAYER_JOIN messages

### Connection Flow Improvements
- Host no longer immediately thinks it's connected after processing answer
- Both sides wait for actual WebRTC "connected" state before considering connection established
- Data channel setup is deferred until connection is actually established
- Proper error handling and state management throughout the flow

## Manual Testing Notes
- Test with network inspector open to monitor WebRTC connection states
- Verify console logs show proper connection progression
- Test connection resilience by refreshing one tab and reconnecting
- Verify chat history and user identification in messages
